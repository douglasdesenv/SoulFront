<h1>SoulFront is a JavaScript Component Library.</h1>

<h3>The objective of this project is:</h3>

- I improve my development skills with Javascript and jQuery;
- Create a repository with basic interface elements for quick reference.

<h3>The development proposal:</h3>

- Encode using the most current versions of ECMAScript;
- Improve codes whenever I learn better ways of doing it;
- Create simple and organized codes;
- Create components with basic functionality, always emphasizing the easy understanding of the code.
- Develop original codes and unrelated to other components, libraries or frameworks (except the jQuery library).

<h3>Component index:</h3>

<ul>
  <ol>Tootip</ol>
  <ol>Carousel</ol>
  <ol>Image Zoom</ol>
</ul>
