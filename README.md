SoulFront is a JavaScript Component Library.

The objective of this project is:

- I improve my development skills with Javascript and jQuery;
- Create a repository with basic interface elements for quick reference.

The development proposal:

- Encode using the most current versions of ECMAScript;
- Improve codes whenever I learn better ways of doing it;
- Create simple and organized codes;
- Create components with basic functionality, always emphasizing the easy understanding of the code.
- Develop original codes and unrelated to other components, libraries or frameworks (except the jQuery library).

Component index:

  1 - Tootip
  2 - Carousel
